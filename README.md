# TwlBgBank-GM9
TwlBgBank is a GodMode9 script for managing external TwlBg.cxi files, preferrably created with [TWPatch](https://gbatemp.net/threads/twpatcher-ds-i-mode-screen-filters-and-patches.542694/).

TwlBg is a core part of TWL_FIRM. TWL_FIRM enables backwards compatibility with DS and DSi titles. TwlBg handles a lot of core functions of TWL_FIRM, including displaying and scaling the screen. TWPatch dumps this to the SD card and allows you to apply several patches to it, for Luma to load if the "external FIRMS and modules" option is enabled when playing DS/DSi titles.

TwlBgBank allows you to easily manage these patched dumps, so you don't have to re-patch the entire TwlBg if you want to change the patches applied to TwlBg. For example, you can have a Widescreen-patched TwlBg whenever you need it, or a scaler specifically for Pok√©mon games. How about a TwlBg for rtcom so you don't always need to have it enabled? The possibilities are endless!

## Setup
* Make sure the latest version of [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9) is on your SD card.
* Go [here](https://github.com/HTV04/TwlBgBank-GM9/releases/latest) and download the TwlBgBank.gm9 file to the \gm9\scripts folder on your SD card.

# Instructions
Using the script is really easy. Open the script by pressing HOME while after booting into GodMode9, choosing "Scripts...", then "TwlBgBank."

You'll be greeted with four options:
* Choose from bank
  * Choose a file from the bank to set as the current TwlBg.
* Add current TwlBg to bank
  * Name the current TwlBg and add it to the bank.
* Delete from bank
  * Delete a TwlBg from the bank.
* Delete current TwlBg
  * Delete the current TwlBg so the 3DS is forced to load the stock TwlBg.
